Simple Weapon Restrict System for FiveM that uses Discord Ids. You shouldn't have to touch anything outside of the config.lua file. Let me know if you find any problems with it!

I tried to make it as light weight/optimized as possible. Ngl this was a one day script so hasn't gone through as much testing as I would have liked but... it's free 🤷🏾‍♂️
